# GreifPvpTroll3
 A bot for Minecraft anarchy servers that implements a GPT-3 chatbot.

### Current Progress
 Currently, a custom GPT-3 based chatbot class is fully implemented. It allows you to choose what personality traits the chatbot has, it's role as a chatbot, and other parameters of the GPT-3 engine. It can keep a running conversation going up to the limitations of the `text-davinci-003` model (4096 "tokens", or approximately 16,384 characters / 3,072â€¬ words).
 
 Not much else is implemented yet.
